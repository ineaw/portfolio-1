        <h3>üìÑ Report</h3>
        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="cross-course text">I made most of the improvements for this for the IXD CA. The only feedback for the IXD CA was to show in the navigation what page I the user is on. So I changed the font weight for the breadcrumb link you are on to heavy, and also added a line under the page you are on in the main navigation.</p>
        <p class="cross-course text">I added sort buttons for the jacket pages so you can sort between high and low prices. I tried to work out how to save the items to a cart page using Localstorage, but I could not make it properly. For now you can add items to cart on the page you are in. I will keep working on it.</p>
        <p class="cross-course text">I changed the navigation bar, added new in(featured) link in navigation, removed about and contact and moved them to the footer area. I removed all of the hr that I had in my HTML, as it is deprecated, and changed it with the pseudo class ::after or ::before where it was suitable.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p class="cross-course text">This project has come a long way since it was originally created as my first ever website, I am pleased with the layout and functionality, for now. There are of course things I would like to improve when it comes to the javascript, I tried and could not manage it.</p>

        <h3>üìÑ Report</h3>
        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">My focus on this project was to try to clean up the extremely messy code from before, at least this shows me there has been some progress.</p>
        <p>I also tidied up the ¬´exterior¬ª on mosts places. It still has a way to go, this was a challenge, trying to improve without breaking it completely. As I look back at this project, I realize I was very blank and did not understand very well what and I how was doing things.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">I removed the sub-navigation bar and added more links to the main navigation, but I ¬´brought along¬ª the hover effect from the sub-navigation to keep the bright green effect and contrast as you hover.</p>
        <p>It also works as an indication on what page you are on when I website size. And I removed all of the ¬´jumps¬ª in between pages and sections, which I probably thought was great once.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I changed the grid layout on all of the pages from being full card on every page, to making a mix of full size cards and two cards in a row for less scrolling, and for the visuals. And I removed half of the cards on the homepage and changed them for the pages instead of all exhibitions. All of the cards have gotten a border-radius and also a more intense drop-shadow to really pop out much more than before.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I changed all of the forms, removed a weird border that I had, probably not intentionally, around my newsletter sign-up form.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I redid the logo in illustrator, and also saw that I had typo in the logo class which made me not be able to target it in the previous submission.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">Conclusion is that I am happy to see the progress I have made, mistakes and how I keep learning and growing. It is still not optimal but an improvement. I wanted to add more functionality like buying a ticket, and so on, but time was not with me. Hopefully I will be more effecient on solving challenges in the future.</p>

        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">Fixed my modal as I forgot a " in the code, which made the image full original size, and overflowing on mobile version. Took a little while to find that tiny mistake.</p>
        <p>I also added a section with links where you can go to a blog page based on what category you want to see. which means I also added categories in Wordpress, which I did not do for the exam.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">Realized I decalred the wrong class in my contact form js, so I sorted that and now the eventlistener actually works. Also fixed the indents on the contact form HTML. I`m having problems with my prettier extension, it only works now and then. I tried "every" fix from various forums, but still not working. It makes it hard to keep the code super neat, as I have to tidy it manually.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">To top of this semester I managed to do something in my functions.php as I was trying to follow the docs in WP documentation for displayig comments on my post, I could not figure out how to fix it as it happened right before delivery. So my only solution with a tired head was to make another a new Wordpress site. Just so I could make sure I was displaying content on my pages.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">I also wrote in my report about the pagination part that I first did on my load more page. But I got very unsure if it was the right thing to do, so now, after reading my feedback, I have changed it back to its original.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">I think I had misunderstood the concept of show where you are in the navigation, and thinking of the breadcrumbs as the navigation. I have now added a underline to the page you are currently on in the navigation. I also wrote in my report about the pagination part that I first did on my load more page. But I got very unsure if it was the right thing to do, so now, after reading my feedback, I have changed it back to its original.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">I removed the horizontal scrollbar on the carousel, but you can still scroll it or use the offset buttons. I also made the images full width as they were cropped before, looking squished. I still want to find a better solution for this, I already tried offset, and also loading posts every time the button was clicked. But this was not the functionality I was looking for, so I will keep working out a better solution as mentioned above.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">Changed the grid values and break point on the post page, so that both post and recent is centered and the recent part does not get squashed. After doing this I read on the exam feedback that this was an issue, so good thing I already fixed it.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text"></p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">I look at this project and see my progression, and even if it still has flaws and can be improved I feel content for now, and I have done my best. Can`t wait to progress further and keep evolving. I definately learn the mosts from my mistakes.</p>
