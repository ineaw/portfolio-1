        <h3>üìÑ Report</h3>
        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="cross-course text">On this project I was sure most of the code was ok, but there was still some things missing, also removed the / infornt of the filepaths. In the beginning I thought that was how it was supposed to be done, but I learned after the semester project that was not the way to do it. Where I got that idea I do not remember. I made most of the improvements for this for the IXD CA. The only feedback for the IXD CA was to show in the navigation what page I the user is on. So I changed the font weight for the breadcrumb link you are on to heavy, and also added a line under the page you are on in the main navigation.</p>
        <p class="cross-course text">I added sort buttons for the jacket pages so you can sort between high and low prices. I tried to work out how to save the items to a cart page using Localstorage, but I could not make it properly. For now you can add items to cart on the page you are in. I will keep working on it.</p>
        <p class="cross-course text">I changed the navigation bar, added new in(featured) and All link in navigation, removed contact and moved it to the footer area. I also moved the logo to far left, so the navigation links would not be squished into it. Also moved the navigation links from left to right, so they would be on the same side as the hamburger menu.</p>
        <p>I removed all of the hr that I had in my HTML, as it is deprecated, and changed it with the pseudo class ::after or ::before where it was suitable.</p>
        <p class="cross-course text">A favorites page was added as I thinking to use it the same way as my checkout/cart page, at least now the icon leads somewhere</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="cross-course text">This project has come a long way since it was originally created as my first ever website, I am pleased with the layout and functionality, for now. There are of course things I would like to improve when it comes to the javascript, I tried and could not manage it.</p>

        <h3>üìÑ Report</h3>
        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">My focus on this project was to try to clean up the extremely messy code from before, at least this shows me there has been some progress.</p>
        <p>There was missing many essential things like language in the head, some titles, alt texts and unique meta descriptions, there were also some questionable code in there</p>
        <p>I also tidied up the ¬´exterior¬ª on mosts places. It still has a way to go, this was a challenge, trying to improve without breaking it completely. As I look back at this project, I realize I was very blank and did not understand very well what and I how was doing things.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">The header and navigation was changed from fixed to sticky in CSS. I wanted to keep most of the original design and thoughts even if much of the code was changed. The text on the hero image had very low contrast, I changed the image to be more "alive" and something that would still look interesting even if it only showed a bit of it, also made th card much bigger, with a cta button instead of the arrow, to make the user go to the featured exhibition.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I removed the sub-navigation bar and added more links to the main navigation, but I ¬´brought along¬ª the hover effect from the sub-navigation to keep the bright green effect and contrast as you hover.</p>
        <p>It also works as an indication on what page you are on when I website size. And I removed all of the ¬´jumps¬ª in between pages and sections, which I probably thought was great once.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I changed the grid layout on all of the pages from being full card on every page, to making a mix of full size cards and two cards in a row for less scrolling, and for the visuals. And I removed half of the cards on the homepage and changed them for the pages instead of all exhibitions. All of the cards have gotten a border-radius and also a more intense drop-shadow to really pop out much more than before.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I changed all of the forms, removed a weird border that I had, probably not intentionally, around my newsletter sign-up form.</p>
        <p class="semester-report text">I redid the logo in illustrator, and also saw that I had typo in the logo class which made me not be able to target it in the previous submission.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="semester-report text">Conclusion is that I am happy to see the progress I have made, mistakes and how I keep learning and growing. It is still not optimal but an improvement. I wanted to add more functionality like buying a ticket, and so on, but time was not with me. Hopefully I will be more effecient on solving challenges in the future.</p>

        <h3>üìÑ Report</h3>
        <h4>JS, HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">Fixed my modal as I forgot a " in the code, which made the image full original size, and overflowing on mobile version. Took a little while to find that tiny mistake.</p>
        <p>I also added a section with links where you can go to a blog page based on what category you want to see. which means I also added categories in Wordpress, which I did not do for the exam.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">Realized I decalred the wrong class in my contact form js, so I sorted that and now the eventlistener actually works. Also fixed the indents on the contact form HTML. I`m having problems with my prettier extension, it only works now and then. I tried "every" fix from various forums, but still not working. It makes it hard to keep the code super neat, as I have to tidy it manually.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">To top of this semester I managed to do something in my functions.php as I was trying to follow the docs in WP documentation for displayig comments on my post, I could not figure out how to fix it as it happened right before delivery. So my only solution with a tired head was to make another a new Wordpress site. Just so I could make sure I was displaying content on my pages.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">I also wrote in my report about the pagination part that I first did on my load more page. But I got very unsure if it was the right thing to do, so now, after reading my feedback, I have changed it back to its original.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">I think I had the wrong idea of the concept of show where you are in the navigation, and thinking of the breadcrumbs as the navigation. I have now added a underline to the page you are currently on in the navigation. I also wrote in my report about the pagination part that I first did on my load more page. But I got very unsure if it was the right thing to do, so now, after reading my feedback, I have changed it back to its original.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">I removed the horizontal scrollbar on the carousel, but you can still scroll it or use the offset buttons. I also made the images full width as they were cropped before, looking squished. I still want to find a better solution for this, I already tried offset, and also loading posts every time the button was clicked. But this was not the functionality I was looking for, so I will keep working out a better solution as mentioned above.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text">Changed the grid values and break point on the post page, so that both post and recent is centered and the recent part does not get squashed. After doing this I read on the exam feedback that this was an issue, so good thing I already fixed it.</p>
        <p class="exam-report text"></p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="exam-report text">I look at this project and see my progression, and even if it still has flaws and can be improved I feel content for now, and I have done my best. I wanted to add the level 2 parts of the assignment, and I was so close, but something just was not working.</p>
      </section>
      <h3>Final words</h3>
      <p>Can`t wait to progress further and keep evolving. I definately learn the mosts from my mistakes. I am still not good about asking for help and directions. I am not sure when we are allowed to ask for help or not, but my goal for the next year is to ask for help and assitance more often. I spend so much time trying to figure out how to solve problems, and being very close to the solution, but giving up. And that it soemthing I will work on. All over I have done the best that I can, and what motivates me is that I see progression with every assignment. Can`t wait for year 2.</p>
